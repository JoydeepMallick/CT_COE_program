Example : Companies providing a service or product always record customer feedback, collect info, and others which is unstructured also called the big data and then analyse the data with tools like databricks to make meaning out of it and then analyze the market risk of launching a new service or product and improve opon it.

* The processing of big data here is done using apache spark.

* Azure implemented Apache Spark within their ecosystem integrating it which is  **Azure Databricks**

Databricks community edition is lifetime <span style="color:green">free databricks service with limited functions good for learning and experimenting.</span>

### We will use this since Azure Databricks is completely paid service with no free trialüò¢üò¢üò¢

Databricks when integrated with any cloud hosting provider like Azure, AWS, GCP ..... will be paid so avoid it if money is a issue.

Video link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUVUiVbI2UU


An Azure Databricks Workspace is an environment for accessing all the Azure Databricks assets.

Workspace organises below objects into folders :-
- Notebooks
- Libraries
- Experiments

We can manage the workspace using Workspace UI, the Databricks CLI, and the databricks Rest API.

<p style="color:yellow">
In the workspace UI we can get help by clicking ? icon on top right hand corner.
</p>
<p style="color:yellow">
The shortcut link displays keyboard shortcuts for working with notebooks.

Azure Databricks is structured to enable secure cross functional team collaboration while keeping a significant amount of backend services managed by Azure  Databricks so we can stay focused on our data science, data analytics, and data engineering tasks.

Azure databricks operated on **<span style="color:yellow">control plane</span>** and **<span style="color:yellow">data plane</span>**.

* The **control plane** includes the backend services that Azure Databricks manages in its own Azure account. Notebook commands and many other workspace configurations are stored in the control plane and encrypted in the rest.

* The **data plane** is managed by our Azure account and is where our data resides. This is also where the data is processed.
