# Assignment

1. Create a dummy data generator code in Python that creates a realtime stream of random numbers between 50 to 100 every 2 seconds 

2. Create an Event Hub that captures the real time stream 

3. Capture the incoming event hubs stream using Structured Streaming in Databricks 

4. Add a column '`Risk`' to the stream where if `value > 80` then risk will be '`High`' else '`Low`' 

5. Capture the output stream in a seperate Event Hub 

6. Connect the output stream to Power BI using Stream Analytics 

7. Build a realtime dashboard in Power BI that counts number of High and Low risk values.
