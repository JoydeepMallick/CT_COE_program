|---------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | 20/5/24   | What is Python till Output Variables      | 4hrs        | Installation process of Python and its dependencies, package manager pip, types of packages in Python, virtual environment concept using venv, conda, etc. Understood Python variable nomenclature using snake case, no need of data type before variables, and storing multiple output values in a single variable using packing and unpacking. |
| 1       | 21/5/24   | Global variables till Python string methods | 3hrs        | Learnt about variables in Python, different available numeric types in Python (int, float, complex), type casting, Python string slicing concept, formatted strings, escape sequences in Python, and many string methods available.                          |
| 1       | 22/5/24   | Boolean Operators till Sorting Lists      | 4hrs        | Learnt about Boolean Operators in Python, and different operators in general (Assignment, Comparison, Bitwise, Membership, Identity Logical and Arithmetic). Learnt concept of List (mutable) in Python, learnt accessing elements, appending elements and extending set of elements or iterable to list. Came to know difference between pop, del, clear and remove commands. Learnt looping through elements using for, while, and list comprehension. Also learnt about inbuilt sort and reverse functions to be applied with list with different optional parameters to tweak it. |
| 1       | 23/5/24   | Python tuples till Python Join tuples     | 4hrs        | Learnt about tuples similar to lists but immutable, accessing elements within tuples, indirectly updating tuples (both inserting and deleting) by converting to list and then back to tuple. Learnt about the concept of packing and unpacking in detail with example of tuples. Looping through using for and while loops. Came to know about join operation on tuples using + operation to concatenate 2 tuples and multiply operator * to replicate the content of tuple at end. |
| 1       | 24/5/24   | Python sets till Python Join sets         | 4hrs        | Learnt about sets which contain only unique values no duplicates, accessing elements of a set. Adding elements using add function and adding iterables using set function. Learnt the difference between pop, remove, discard, clear, and del commands with examples. Learnt different set operations in Python like union, update, intersection, difference and symmetric_difference. |
| 1       | 25/5/24   | Python Dictionaries till Assignments      | 4hrs        | Learnt concept of dictionary, how they contain unique keys only and are key : value pairs. Applying keys and values function to access elements of a dictionary. Learnt about adding elements and updating a dictionary, removing items using functions pop, popitem, del, and clear. Looping through dictionaries and creating nested dictionaries. Completed assignments. |
