# Assignment

1. Create **4 notebooks** in Databricks that read from single table and inserts/updates data into **5 respective output Delta tables** 

2. Create an **orchestration notebook** that calls the other notebooks using `Dbutils` 

3. Create a **parallel orchestration notebook** that calls the 5 notebooks in parallel using concurrent notebook workflow 

4. Create **Jobs** for both the notebooks using Databricks Jobs API 

5. Schedule the jobs using **Jobs API**. Use **Clusters API** to create similar compute cluster for both. 

6. Compare **runtime of sequential and parallel jobs**
